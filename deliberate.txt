Deliberate Practice and Brood War Pedagogy

- What is deliberate practice
1. Deliberate practice is focused.
2. Pushes personal boundaries. Motivation and exertion.
3. Repeatable, drillable
4. Based on what you currently know.
5. Informative feedback on your performance.
- How can these apply to brood war?
1. Don't mass game. If improvement is your goal, don't play at all unless you're ready and able to be 100%.
2. Set benchmarks and exceed them. Be critical but not self-flagellating. Cut with a laser, not an axe.
3. Those benchmarks need to be relative to your current capabilities. Trying to run a marathon when you can't run a mile isn't going to work.
4. Use techniques and practice methods that are easy to repeat. Full games are the performance, not the practice.
5. Replays are your feedback. Learn to love them. Learn to really work them.
